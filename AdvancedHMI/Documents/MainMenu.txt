Main menu form stays open all the time. This form will contain all of the Form Change navigation buttons.
To use the new items:
- In Solution Explorer, right click the AdvancedHMI project and select Properties
- Under the application tab change the Startup Form to MainMenu

Create new forms. Set the FormBorderStyle to None for all forms. 
After creating additional forms and Building the project, add menu buttons for them:
	- In Solution Explorer, expand down the AdvancedHMI project, then expand down to FormChangeControls\MainMenuDriven
	- Double the MainMenu.vb to open in Design View
	- From the Toolbox add a MainMenuButton for each new form
	- Set the FormToOpen property
	- You can also set the OpenOnStartup property for one button to indicate the default startup form

On the MainMenu is an Exit button. This button searches for hidden forms to ensure they are properly disposed when closing an application.

Main Menu form can also be used for "global" style functions such as changing forms based on a PLC value since it stays open and will always keep PLC communications active.
